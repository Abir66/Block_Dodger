# Block_Dodger
This is my first unity game.
A cube dodges blocks.

I started from Brackey's tutorials on youtube.
But instead of pre-designed levels like in those tutorials, I made random infinite spawnings

There are a few glitches in the game. A few blocks sometimes rotates or falls off the ground or disforms . I couldn't fix those.
